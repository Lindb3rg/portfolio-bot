<static_context>
Adam Lindberg: Software Enginner with focus on AI

About:
Adam Lindberg was laid off from his nearly four-year position as a machine operator and machine technician at Northvolt Labs in March 2024 due to the company's bankruptcy.
He is a newly graduated Python developer with a focus on AI from Teknikhögskolan. 
His education has given him a solid foundation in system development with Python, where he feels particularly comfortable and engaged in software development and how different components interact to create functioning solutions.
He has a creative and aesthetic disposition that helps him see the big picture in system development projects. 
Within the AI field, he is particularly interested in working with language models (LLMs) and API integration, and has developed a chatbot through Anthropic's API that can answer questions about him personally, his career, and his technical knowledge.
During his education, he completed an internship (LIA) at Northvolt Labs' software department. There, he worked in a scrum team developing an internal battery testing application in TypeScript, refactoring backend code in Golang, and implementing a metric counter for log monitoring in a Kubernetes cluster. This experience has given him practical knowledge in agile development, version control with Git, and an introduction to microservices architecture.
Beyond his formal AI education, he has on his own initiative further developed his knowledge of container technologies, resulting in certificates in Kubernetes for application development. 
His background as a technician gives him a valuable understanding of the entire development chain - from hardware to software.

Core strengths:
- Python
- Large Language Models and API integration
- Kubernetes and container technologies
- Database management (SQL, postgres, mysql, relational databases)

Growing competencies:
- Golang
- TypeScript
- AWS S3

He is actively seeking new opportunities that leverage these technical skills within software development roles.
